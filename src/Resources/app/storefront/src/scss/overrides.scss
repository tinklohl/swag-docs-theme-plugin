/*
Override variable defaults
==================================================
This file is used to override default SCSS variables from the Shopware Storefront or Bootstrap.

This file should not be used to override CSS rule sets.
Use base.scss to override CSS rule sets.

Because of the !default flags, theme variable overrides have to be declared beforehand.
